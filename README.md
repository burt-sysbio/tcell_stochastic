# Modeling T cell fate decisions as a stochastic process
## Keywords
JULIA, mathematical modeling, stochastic process, semi-markov process, cell fate decisions
### Description
I here use the JULIA language to simulate a stochastic fate decision of T cells in the context of acute and chronic inflammation. JULIA is well-suited for these kind of brute-force simulations that comprise several nested loops with conditional evaluation that are cumbersome to vectorize in python.
